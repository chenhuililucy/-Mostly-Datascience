# Stats-and-Probablity-Contests
Some new toolkits and materials I use to study (contains some random snippets of codes which I refer to/wrote myself) 

 This folder contains files which I use to self teach 
 
 1. Basic ML/stats 
 2. Codes for my Finance final honours school course 
 3. Some hackerrank practice I did and some coding competitions I participated in when I first started programming. 
 This folder does not include anything in my NLP dictionary project (private as of now).
