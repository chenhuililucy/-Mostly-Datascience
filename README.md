# Stats-and-Probablity-Contests
Some new toolkits and materials I use to study (contains some random snippets of codes which I refer to/wrote myself) 

 This folder contains files which I use to self teach basic ML/stats, some hackerrank practice I did and some coding competitions I particiapated when I first started programming. 
 This folder does not include anything in my NLP dictionary project (private as of now).
